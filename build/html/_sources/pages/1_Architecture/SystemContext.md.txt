There are two user profiles on this application: patient and physician.

<p style="text-align: center;">

</p>

The functionalities of these two profiles will be practically the same, the only difference being that a doctor can manage several patients with the application while patients will only be able to manage their own case.

Thus, the functionalities of the Dx29 application will be as follows:
>- Find and organize patient symptoms. Automatically find patient symptoms in his/her medical reports in virtually any language and organize patient history.
>- Seize patient little time with physicians. Arrange patient data chronologically to tell his/her medical history fast and center on what is important.
>- Share patient information. Share a case with a physician. If you are a Physician you can manage multiple cases from your patients panel.
>- Analise patient data. Use state-of-the-art algorithms to predict what rare disease fits patient data. Add genetic information, if available, for more accurate results.
